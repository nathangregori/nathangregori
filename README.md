## About me

**nathangregori/nathangregori** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Nathan Gregori â€” finance graduate, elite fencer, and AI strategist on a mission to shape the future. From trauma to triumph, Paris to Hong Kong, I fuse logic, creativity, and resilience to build what matters.
